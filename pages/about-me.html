                My name is Harsh, and I am a student who attends highschool. I don’t have a lot of coding
                or web development experience, but I have taken two courses at Codeacademy for some HTML and Python. However, I do not have any personal projects at the moment. Some things about me are that I enjoy playing basketball with my friends (even though I’m not too good at it), and playing video games. My favorite school courses are most of the sciences and math. I do various extracurriculars such as taekwondo, on track to becoming a lifeguard post-COVID, Royal Canadian Air Cadets, school robotics team, grade 9-10 badminton team, grade 10 volleyball team, DECA, and SAC.</p>

            I have various interests in many different areas, such as technology, the stock market, and health sciences. I genuinely enjoy learning more about technology, especially about things like AI and cryptocurrency. I find it interesting how technology is always moving forward. Whether it be self-driving cars or robots, there can still be improvements to be made. Ever since I was a kid, I had seen my dad keep track of stocks he had purchased, and that interest somehow was transferred to me. I keep up with news about the economy and some stocks of companies that I find quite interesting. I have always admired Warren Buffet and enjoy reading some books written by or about him. For the longest time, I have been interested in how the human body works. I like reading about it, watching documentaries, and even watching medical dramas such as The Good Doctor and Grey’s Anatomy. It astounds me how we use these complex organ systems every minute, yet we still know so little about them.
