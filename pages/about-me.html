                My name is Harsh, and I am a student who attends highschool. I don’t have a lot<br> of coding or web development experience, but I have taken two courses at Codeacademy<br> for some HTML and Python. However, I do not have any personal projects at the moment.<br> Some things about me are that I enjoy playing basketball with my friends (even though<br> I’m not too good at it), and playing video games. My favorite school courses are most of the<br> sciences and math. I do various extracurriculars such as taekwondo, on track to becoming a <br> lifeguard post-COVID, Royal Canadian Air Cadets, school robotics team, grade 9-10<br> badminton team, grade 10 volleyball team, DECA, and SAC.</p>

            <p id="about-me-text-2">
                I have various interests in many different areas, such as technology, the stock market, and<br> health sciences. I genuinely enjoy learning more about technology, especially about things<br> like AI and cryptocurrency. I find it interesting how technology is always moving forward.<br> Whether it be self-driving cars or robots, there can still be improvements to be made. Ever<br> since I was a kid, I had seen my dad keep track of stocks he had purchased, and that interest<br> somehow was transferred to me. I keep up with news about the economy and some stocks<br> of companies that I find quite interesting. I have always admired Warren Buffet and enjoy<br> reading some books written by or about him. For the longest time, I have been interested in<br> how the human body works. I like reading about it, watching documentaries, and even<br> watching medical dramas such as The Good Doctor and Grey’s Anatomy. It astounds me<br>how we use these complex organ systems every minute, yet we still know so little about them.
